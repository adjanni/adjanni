### Greetings from Norway, I am Axel 👋

I am a **signal processing geophysicist** with expertise in **Machine Learning**. My aim is to use my current skill and gain competencies to impact medical imaging, diagnostic and therapeutic medicine, and radar imaging. My interest in medical imaging led me to enrolled to the **[Computer Vision Expert Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891)**. I am currently working, part-time, on the development of a mathematical formula to improve the estimation of the Non Propagation Delay in ultrasound medical imaging.

I enjoy working on Matlab, C++/C, Python, and Octave.

I am opened to full-time position as a scientist in signal processing, Machine Learning engineering, or Computer Vision specialist :sparkles: :rocket: .

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Vision, Parallel Computing, and medical ultrasound imaging.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on skin cancer diagnosis using deeplearning and on the increase of the SNR of medical imaging ultrasound through signal processing & ML. 
- 💬 Ask me about ML, CV, or signal processing ...
