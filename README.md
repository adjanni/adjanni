## Greetings from Norway, I am Axel ðŸ‘‹

I am a **signal processing geophysicist** with expertise in **Machine Learning** and **Computer Vision**. My aim is to use my current skill and gain competencies to impact medical imaging, diagnostic and therapeutic medicine, and speech recognition. My 8-years old cannot create constructive words and pronounce speeches as fluent as kids of his age. This is another source of motivation to invest my time and to utilise ML or DL to help him and other children of his kind.

### My Interest :sparkles: 
My interest in medical imaging led me to enrolled to the **[Computer Vision Expert Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891)**. I am currently working, part-time, on the development of a mathematical formula to improve the estimation of the Non Propagation Delay in ultrasound medical imaging.

I enjoy working on Matlab, C++/C, Python, and Octave.

I'm opened to full-time position as a scientist in Signal Processing, Machine Learning engineering, or Computer Vision specialist :rocket:.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Vision, Parallel Computing, and medical ultrasound imaging
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on skin cancer diagnosis using deeplearning and on the increase of the SNR of medical imaging ultrasound through signal processing & ML
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ML, CV, or Signal Processing
